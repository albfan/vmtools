This package contains classes that manipulate OTA XML documents and
represent some of the elements used in
OTA XML documents.
</p>

<p>
The <code>OtaUpdate</code> class compares two XML documents and generates
an OTA update request. It also applies an OTA update request to a document
to generate the updated version.
</p>

<p>
The <code>UniqueId</code> class represents the UniqueId element used in some
OTA documents. There are some mandatory attributes that must be given as parameters
to the constructor, and other optional attributes that can be set later. The
class includes a method to build a JDOM Element containing the object's
information.
