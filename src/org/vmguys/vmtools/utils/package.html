<p>This package contains classes that manipulate XML data.</p>

<p>The primary class is <code>JdomDifferenceFinder</code>. It generates and applies difference files.
If given two pieces of XML data, it will generate a difference file that will
show the differences between the data. If given a piece of XML data and a difference file, 
it will apply the update and return the modified data.</p>

<p>The class that performs the work to find the differences between two pieces of
XML data is <code>DifferenceFinder2</code>. It takes as input two JDOM trees and returns
information about the minimal differences between the trees in a CostOps object.</p>

<p>The remaining classes (<code>CostOps</code>, <code>XPath</code>,
and the <code>XxxxxOperation</code> classes) all provide support for the previous classes.</p>
